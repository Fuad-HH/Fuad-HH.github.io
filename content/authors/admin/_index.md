Hi 👋, I am Fuad Hasan, a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). I work as a Research Assistant at the [Lab for Accelerated Computing In Engineering and Science (LACES)](https://laces-lab.github.io/). My research specializes in computational methods for fusion and fission energy, where I develop performance portable libraries for neutral particle simulation in distributed unstructured meshes. My work focuses on GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo tallies, multiphysics coupling for fusion reactor modeling. Beyond research, I enjoy history, geopolitics, and cooking.
